## License
This software is released under GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version. Please read the license file if you haven't already done so.

## Download and Running
You can download the latest executable version for Mac and Windows from the project's website: <https://leoregner.eu/product/2>

After starting the application, a small icon can be found in the system tray (menu bar / task bar). If you select the item "open" from its menu, a new tab will open up in your standard web browser. Within this tab, the music will be playing, which is currently selected in your local iTunes player. Therefore, the music can easily be streamed to any device with Chromecast built-in.

Just continue using iTunes on your computer or via your favorite iTunes remote app. As long as TunesCast is running, your music will continue being played through your TV or speakers.
